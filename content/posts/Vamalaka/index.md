Vamalaka is an e-commerce international trading platform that helps people in Madagascar sell their products globally. It follows the "Direct to Consumer" business model.

As an implementation technology we have chosen: TypeScript, React, Redux, Redux Tool Kit, and Cypress for integration testing. We used NodeJS containerized backend that exposes GraphQL interface with MongoDB as a source of data.
