This Malagasy application is built with React Native. It helps people to learn Malagasy and English. Users can see the lists of the available topics that they are going to learn and there is a quiz for them to play around with.

By teaming with three other developers, we built the UI components of the application. We followed the CDD (Component Driven Development) approach and used a storybook to develop and test the components. To manage the state we used Redux to make the code maintainable and easy to work with in the future.
